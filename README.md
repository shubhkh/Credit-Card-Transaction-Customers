Credit Card Weekly Status Dashboard - Power BI

Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI, integrating SQL data to track credit card transactions, revenue, and customer behavior on a weekly basis.

Created custom metrics using DAX, such as Revenue, Customer Age Group, and Income Group, along with comparative analyses (e.g., Current Week vs. Previous Week Revenue).

Visualized key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends such as revenue growth (+28.8% in Week 53), customer demographics, and transaction counts.

Conducted year-to-date analysis, revealing total revenue of $57M and 93% of transactions driven by Blue and Silver credit cards.

Delivered data-driven insights that empowered business decision-making and were shared with stakeholders for operational reporting and strategic planning.
This highlights your technical skills in data processing, SQL, DAX, and Power BI while focusing on the project's impact.
